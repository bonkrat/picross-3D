# Picross 3D

A work-in-progress 3D picross game, similar to Nintendo's Picross 3D. Probably won't ever come back to this but was a fun experiments as an introduction to 3D web graphics.

- React for web components.
- `react-three-fiber` for building three.js components with JSX.
- `drei` for react-three-fiber helper components.
